# Flappy_Bird_Clone

A flappy bird clone which is my first attempt at game creation for Android.

The game is created using lidgdx framework and is an attempt to create something similar to the popular/infuriating Flappy Bird game.
The game simply requires you to constantly tap to navigate the bird sprite through a series of gaps between a bottom and top obstacle. 

The sprites detect if they overlap (using simple shapes) and if they do the game ends and allows you to restart with a simple click.
